# Title: CAMS Radiation Service v4.6 all-sky irradiation (derived from satellite data).
# Content:  A time-series of solar radiation received on horizontal plane and plane always normal to the sun rays at ground level.
#           Returns the global, beam and diffuse irradiations integrated over a selected time step,
#           for a selected location (geostationary satellite coverage) and a selected period.
# The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union within the Copernicus programme.
# Provider: VAISALA with MINES ParisTech (France) and DLR (Germany)
